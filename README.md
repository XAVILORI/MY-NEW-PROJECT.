BUILDING Artificial Intelligence COURSE PROJECT

## SUMMARY

THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT THE USABILITY OF THE GITHUB RESPOSITORY WITH UNDERSTANDING OF THE ELEMENTS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FIVE CHAPTER COURSE. THE GITHUB README FILE WILL CONTAIN MY MOST UPDATE CURRICULUM VITAE. 


## BACKGROUND

THE SOLUTION WILL GIVE PROSPECTS AN ONLINE PLATFORM TO FIND THE REQUIRED PERSONNEL FOR THE SKILLSET REQUIRED FOR THE EMPLOYMENT POSITION. THIS SOLUTION WILL DECREASE THE DEPENDENCY OF THE EMPLOYEES REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER EMPLOYMENT WEBSITES. ENABLING GITHUB AS A RELATIVE OPTION. MY PERSONAL MOTIVATION IS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF THE REPOSITORY WITHIN THE GITHUB. THE INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE OF THE USE OF GITHUB WITH UNDERSTANDING OF BUILDING OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ILLUSTRATES THE INCREASE OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BEGINNER TO ADVANCED LEVEL WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BUILDING TO DISPLAY THEIR CURRENT ATTRIBUTES THROUGH A CODE BUILDING SOFTWARE. 


THE DOCUMENT: CURRICULUM VITAE IS A REVIEWABLE DOCUMENT TO GAIN INTEREST FROM SUITABLE ONLINE REVIEWERS WITH CURRENT EMPLOYMENT INTEREST.

THE SOLUTION CAN BE REVIEWED DURING THE EVENTS OF A VIRTUAL INTERVIEW. THE TIME WILL ALWAYS BE FORMAL BECAUSE THE USERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

* REAKTOR. 
* GITHUB.
* PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS.
* INDIVIDUALS WHOM DESIRE CURRICULUM VITAE INSPIRATION. 
* A PERSONAL VIRTUAL REFERENCE.

THE NEED WHICH USERS WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN REVIEWING THE SOLUTION FOR VIRTUAL CURRICULUM VITAE DESCRIPTION FORMAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE USE BUILDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IDEA. THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE GITHUB ONCE THE COURSE HAS BEEN CONCLUDED IS A WORTHWHILE TIME WITHIN THE FIRST INITIATION.

## CHALLENGES 

THE PROJECT DOES NOT THE MOST CREATIVE DETAILS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE EXAMPLE REAKTOR BUILDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IDEA FOR THE NEW PROJECT CONTAINED. THE LIMITATIONS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHICH USERS AND REVIEWERS SHOULD HIGHLY UNDERSTAND WHEN REVIEWING AND DEPLOYING A SOLUTION WITH SIMILARITY TO THIS NEW PROJECT IS THE UNCONVENTIONAL OF A LIMITED SPACING WITH THE VOLUME OF TEXT WITH THE DOCUMENT. THIS IS FOR THE REVIEWER TO TAKE THE QUALITY OF THE CURRICULUM VITAE AND NOT QUANTITY OF THE CURRICULUM. THE REPUTATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHOMST DETAILS ARE SHARED WITHIN THE CURRICULUM VITAE IS TO HAVE THE INSIGHT OF THE VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OPTION.

#WHAT NEXT?

THE PROJECT WILL BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP BEYOND THE UNDERSTANDING RECEIVED FROM REAKTOR AND GITHUB. HOWEVER, THE USABILITY OF BOTH PLATFORM MAY CREATE A WORTHWHILE INTEREST AT ANOTHER PROJECT. THE SKILL OF ACCESSING THE README PROJECT WILL ASSIST THE REVIEWERS OF EMPLOYMENT TO FURTHER REMAIN UP-TO-DATE WITH THE USABILITY OF REFERENCES THROUGH THIS LATEST ONLINE PLATFORM.
